Ultrasonic Sensor is used for measuring distance by send high frequency sound
waves. When waves reach a wall they are reflected back. Reflected sound is
detected by the sensor. The time that it takes to comeback can be used to
calculate distance to the wall.

Imagine you are a team of engineers at "Park-Easy," a startup dedicated to enhancing vehicle safety and parking efficiency. Your latest challenge is to address a common problem many drivers face: safely and efficiently parking in tight garage spaces without damaging their vehicle or property.
## The Challenge
Your team has been tasked with developing an innovative solution to help drivers park their vehicles safely in garages, especially those with limited space. After brainstorming, your team decides to create an ultrasonic parktronic system that guides drivers during the parking process, reducing the risk of collisions and ensuring optimal parking alignment.
## Check List
* Verify that the ultrasonic sensor measures distance.
* Check if the distance is correctly displayed on display in the format:
"The distance is X.XX cm.
* Confirm that the LEDs display the correct colors based on the distance measured:
* LEDs show different colors based on the proximity flag calculation.
* Correct number of LEDs light up according to the distance.
* Ensure the buzzer activates correctly when the distance is less than 7 cm.
* Observe the refresh rate and responsiveness (specified delay of 0.2 seconds).`,tokens:[e.ultrasonic,e.piezo,e.display,e["led tower"]]}};export{b as a,e as b,P as c,w as t};
